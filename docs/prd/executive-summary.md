# Executive Summary

The goal is to build a high-fidelity mobile camera application that rivals the native iPhone camera in feature set while distinguishing itself through professional-grade manual controls. This app targets photography enthusiasts and power users who appreciate the quality of the default camera but feel limited by its automatic decision-making. By exposing granular controls for focus, exposure, ISO, and shutter speed alongside replicated native features like Portrait and Night mode, we provide a "Pro" alternative that empowers creative intent without sacrificing the convenience of a smartphone.

## What Makes This Special

While the default iPhone camera prioritizes "point-and-shoot" simplicity with computational photography that often hides decisions from the user, this application serves as a **Pro-grade alternative**. The "aha" moment for users occurs when they can seamlessly toggle between an intelligent auto-mode (comparable to the default app) and a fully manual mode where they dictate the shot's parameters. It fills the gap for users who want the power of a DSLR interface combined with the computational prowess of the iPhone's hardware.

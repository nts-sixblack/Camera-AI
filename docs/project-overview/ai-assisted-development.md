# AI-Assisted Development

When working with this codebase using AI assistance:

1. **For new features**: Reference the PRD at `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
2. **For architecture decisions**: Check `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
3. **For UX patterns**: Review `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
4. **For implementation**: Find stories in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`

The project follows a feature-based structure under `Camera/Features/`. New features should be added as new subdirectories with their own Views, Managers, and ViewModels.

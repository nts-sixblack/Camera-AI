# Architecture Overview

## Pattern: MVVM + Feature-Based Modular Architecture

The Camera app follows a **feature-based modular architecture** combined with **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for individual features. This approach enables:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy feature isolation and testing
- Scalable codebase structure
- Independent feature development

# Executive Summary

## Project Vision

Camera is a pro-grade mobile camera application that rivals the native iPhone camera in feature set while distinguishing itself through professional-grade manual controls. The core value proposition is the seamless toggle between intelligent auto-mode (comparable to the default app) and a fully manual mode where users dictate shot parameters. It fills the gap for photography enthusiasts who want DSLR-level control combined with iPhone's computational prowess.

## Target Users

**Primary:** Photography enthusiasts and power users who appreciate iPhone camera quality but feel limited by automatic decision-making. They want creative control—the ability to intentionally underexpose for drama, lock focus on a specific plane, or set exact white balance for consistency.

**Persona - Elena:** A street photographer who needs to control exposure, focus, and aperture simulation for artistic intent. She shoots in challenging mixed-lighting conditions and wants to capture the mood she sees, not the "safe" exposure the algorithm chooses.

**Secondary Consideration:** "Hand-off" users—people Elena might pass her phone to for a group shot. They need an instantly recognizable, simple interface.

## Key Design Challenges

1. **Complexity vs. Accessibility** - Expose professional controls without overwhelming users
2. **Mode Transition Clarity** - Auto ↔ Pro toggle must be unmistakable and seamless
3. **One-Handed Operation** - Thumb-reachable controls in portrait and landscape
4. **Information Density** - Balance visual aids against viewfinder prominence
5. **Speed Under Pressure** - Settings adjustable in <2 seconds without menu hunting

## Design Opportunities

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Clean viewfinder in Auto; full cockpit in Pro mode
2. **Gestural Controls** - Swipe-based dials with haptics for tactile, fast adjustments
3. **Visual Confidence** - Focus peaking and histogram as competitive differentiators

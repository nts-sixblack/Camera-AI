# File Organization Notes

1. **No Package.swift** - This is a traditional Xcode project, not Swift Package Manager
2. **No CocoaPods/SPM dependencies detected** - Using only Apple frameworks
3. **Feature-first architecture** - Code organized by feature, not by type
4. **Separate test targets** - Unit tests and UI tests in dedicated directories
